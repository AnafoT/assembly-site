## Local Development Setup

This setup will be for both VScode and debugging in the terminal. I'm on Windows 11 using WSL, but that should not matter for the VScode setup.

### Minimum steps required:
- Install WSL --> Ubuntu (I'm on Ubuntu 22)
- Install GCC?

### VScode setup:
- Install VScode
- Install Gcc on windows
- Install the following [TODO: extensions](https://google.com)
    - Debugger
    - Syntax Highlighting
    - (Optional) Documentation
- Setup your debugger as follows:

### Terminal setup:
- Once you have WSL installed, you're practically as good to go, just run the following commands:
    ```
        TODO: 
    ```
- (Recommended): Install gef for better in-terminal debugging support.

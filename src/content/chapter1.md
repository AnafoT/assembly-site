## Understanding Assembly Language

Assembly language is a low-level programming language that provides a direct mapping to machine code instructions. Unlike high-level languages, assembly gives you precise control over the hardware but requires more detailed understanding of the computer's architecture.

### Key Concepts

- **Registers**: Special storage locations in the CPU  
- **Instructions**: Basic operations the CPU can perform  
- **Memory**: How data is stored and accessed  

### Your First Assembly Program

Let's look at a simple "Hello World" program in x86_64 assembly. This program demonstrates the basic structure of an assembly program and how to output text to the console.

> Try modifying the code on the right to change the output message. Click "Run" to see your changes in action.

### Exercise

Modify the program to output your own message. Make sure to:

1. Keep the basic program structure intact  
2. Update only the string in the data section  
3. Maintain proper string termination
